# React Tutorial: Build a ToDo App
This is a Todos App build with React from the tutorial of [Michael Cheng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6smI_YJDE).
Customisation by me with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

To get started with the app:

Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/shlaguaguel/react-todos-tutorial
```

Install node modules with npm
```
$ npm install
```

Launch the server
```
$ webpack-dev-server
```

Go test [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Enjoy!
